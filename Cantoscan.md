# Cantoscan - Canto Blockchain Explorer

Cantoscan is Etherscan for Canto, providing information on transactions, addresses, and smart contracts.

Built from the ground up for speed and stability.

## What's wrong with the current Explorer?

In short: Canto needs it's own explorer that's fast, easy-to-use, performant, and reliable.

The current Canto blockchain explorer is a departure from the Etherscan-like interface that developers have come to expect. Additionally, the explorer is often down or times out with 502 errors.

We built Cantoscan from the ground up using the latest serverless web and database stacks so it's highly performant and can handle any amount of traffic.

We also believe that the Canto explorer should be full of Canto-green and other Canto-like branding.

## What will funding be used for

We'll be using the funding for the following:

### Domains and assets

We've already reached out to the owner of cantoscan.io and cantoscan.com and can acquire these for between $5K and $10K (for both). Right now we have cantoscan.xyz but would like to have the .io like Etherscan.

### Full archive-node

This weekend we're installing a colocated archive node using one of my rackmount servers, currently idle. This will help speed up indexing and allow us to remove any third-party node depencies.

### Hosting

Hosting millions of blocks and transactions will start to add up, we're planning on allocating a portion of the winnngs to paying website, database, and search hosting fees.
